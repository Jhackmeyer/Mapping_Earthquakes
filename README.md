# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Purpose

In this project, we take earthquake data from a couple of online sources, and combine them in a map using html, javascript, leaflet, and geoJSON.

## Results

We generated a map with three map options,

  - Street view
  - Sattelite view
  - Night view
  
and three layers,

  - All earthquakes
  - Fault lines
  - Major Earthquakes
